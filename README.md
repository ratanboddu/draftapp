Getting Started
------------
It is recommended to install DraftApp (and your project's other dependencies) in a virtualenv.

Once you’ve created and activated your Python virtual environment, you can install the latest stable release of DraftApp into this dedicated development workspace:

```
pip install draftapp
```

Set Up a DraftApp project
------------
After you’ve successfully installed DraftApp, you’re ready to create the first draft for your new web application

You can choose from one of the two types:

* A **Basic** App provides you with the basic scaffold needed to get you application up and running for development
* An **Advanced** App provides you with a high-level scaffold for your development needs with Docker & Kubernetes manifests included
